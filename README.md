# **_My Codewars kata solutions_**

My own Codewars kata solutions will be archived in this repository.<br>
As I progress through Codewars I expect to refactor some already completed kata solutions.
<br><br>

### **_Folder structure:_**

I have provided a folder structure which stores kata's inside it's difficulty folder (kyu).
<br>
Each kata comes with a **README** file explaining the kata's problem.
<br>

```
[x-kyu]/[kata name]/main.js
[x-kyu]/[kata name]/README.md
```

<br>

### **_Test cases:_**

Most kata's will come with a couple of test cases so you can print the values in the console. It is great for testing directly in VSCode!
<br>

**Note**: Some kata do not have enough test cases to check all possible values, you should then use the test cases provided by the kata on the Codewars website.
<br>
<br>

## _Difficulty Order: [high to low]_

<ul>
<li>6 kyu</li>
<li>7 kyu</li>
<li>8 kyu</li>
</ul>

<br>
More kata solutions and kyu difficulty folders will be added as I progress through Codewars.
