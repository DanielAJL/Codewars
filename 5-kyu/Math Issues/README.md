<div class="markdown prose max-w-none" id="description"><p>Oh no, our Math object was "accidently" reset. Can you re-implement some of those functions? We can assure, that only non-negative numbers are passed as arguments. So you don't have to consider things like <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>NaN</code>, negative numbers, strings and so on.</p>
<p>Here is a list of functions, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Math.round()</li>
<li>Math.ceil()</li>
<li>Math.floor()</li>
</ul>
